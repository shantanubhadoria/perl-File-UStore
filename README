File-UStore version 0.03
========================


File-UStore  is a perl  library to  store files  on a
filesystem using a UUID based storage around various depths of Storage.

File::UStore is a library that allows users to abstract file storage using a UUID based pointer instead of File Hashes to store the file.  This is
a critical feature for code which requires even duplicate files to get a unique identifier each time they added to a store. A Hash Storage on the
other hand will not allow a file to be duplicated if it is stored multiple time in the store. This can cause issues in cases where a files may be
deleted regularly as there would be no way of knowing if a second process is still using the file which the first process might be about to delete.

The  current version  uses UUID Module to generate universally unique identifiers everytime a file is to be stored.

The Module also provides a option to choose the folder depth at which a file is stored.  This can be changed from the default value of 3.
Increasing depth is advisable if the Store might contain a large number of files in your use case. This helps avoid having an excessive number of
files in any single folder.
